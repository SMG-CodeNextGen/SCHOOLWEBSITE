              <h1>What's the Campus Like?</h1>
              <p id="info">While students are on campus, they will have access to our very high rated canteen, and they will have small churches and temples to visit on campus. For safety reasons, by each dorm sector, there will be 4 guards at the entrance. As a token of our appreciation, we have given some great snacks in their dorms for them to enjoy. The campus is very extensive, so they can relax anywhere on campus.
